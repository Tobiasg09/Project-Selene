{"inkVersion":19,"root":[["^PRISHA: Thank you all for coming here despite the looming threat.","\n","^PRISHA: As some may have noticed, this morning the lights went out.","\n","^PRISHA: This is because someone removed the quantum core from the head generator several hours before and the backup generator was starting to fail.","\n","^PRISHA: Logs show this was done between 9 and 10 this morning.

Maybe we might still be able to stop its impact with their knowledge.","\n","^PRISHA: As the stability and safety of this facility were harmed as a direct consequence of this crime, the perpetrator will be charged with high treason.","\n","^PRISHA: And as per tradition, the crime for high treason is...","\n","^PRISHA: ... death.","\n","^PRISHA: The suspects are: Andy, Kwame, Mei and Piotr.","\n","^PRISHA: Andy is the head electrician and in charge of maintaining the quantum core, which makes him an obvious suspect.","\n","^PRISHA: Kwame was spotted hanging out at the maintenance room at the time of the crime.","\n","^PRISHA: Additionally, the core was found in Mei's room.
