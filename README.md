# Project-Selene

This game was made for the [GitHub Game Off 2020](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020), where we have one month to develop a videogame from scratch that fits a specific theme. The theme for this year was 'Moonshot'. 


# Description of our submission
You are a young Bio-Engineer living and working in a lunar colony, while the Earth faces environmental collapse and political unrest. Explore the lunar surface, hide from pesky chemists and, if possible, save the Moon in this decision-based puzzle rpg called Project Selene.
