ME: The computer said it was missing the main quantum core.
ANDY: Wait, what? Are you sure?
ME: Yeah, I thought it was very weird. These days they put the word quantum in front of everything and it sounds terrifying.
ANDY: Oh no.. This is horrible. It means that someone must have deliberately taken out the core. But why? They must've known what they were doing as well..
ANDY: All right, we have to find the core and worry about who did it later. Let's split up - I'll start with searching the bar. You go search the living quarters.
ME: Sure thing. What does this quantum core look like?
ANDY: It's about knee-height and bright orange. You can't miss it. If you find it, go to the maintenance room and install it as soon as possible.
