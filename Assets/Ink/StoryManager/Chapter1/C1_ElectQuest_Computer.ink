ME: This is the computer Andy was talking about. Let's see what it says.
ME: "Primary visuals - functional"
ME: "Internal circuits - perfect"
ME: "Backup generator - 50%"
ME: "Main core - CRITALLY DAMAGED"
ME: Woah - maybe start with that in the future? 
ME: "Main quantum core not located. Please replace immediately."
ME: That's very strange. Better go back to Andy and tell him.
