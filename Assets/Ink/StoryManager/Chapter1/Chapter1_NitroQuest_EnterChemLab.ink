CHEMIST: Where do you think you're going?
ME: Well this is off to a good start. 
ME: I'm from the Bio-Engineering department upstairs. We are working on increasing the efficiency of growing crops on the lunar surface.
CHEMIST: Ah, so you are a farmer? I didn't know there were any farmers in our section.
ME: ... Right.
ME: So I need some of the nitrogen you guys have been stockpiling.
CHEMIST: I'm afraid not. We need it all ourselves. Now if you could please go away.
ME: I somehow felt this coming.
