We are gathering here to uncover the perpetrator of this crime.","\n","^LEADER: The intent behind this crime seems obvious: for us to be without power so that we wouldn't be able to notice that Drump fired a missile headed for us.","\n","^LEADER: Thus, the goal of this hearing is twofold: firstly, to uncover and correctly punish the perpetrator of this crime.","\n","^LEADER: But also, whoever did this might know more about the incoming missile. Maybe we might still be able to stop its impact with their knowledge.","\n","^LEADER: As the stability and safety of this facility were harmed as a direct consequence of this crime, the perpetrator will be charged with high treason.","\n","^LEADER: And as per tradition, the crime for high treason is...","\n","^LEADER: ... death.","\n","^LEADER: The suspects are: Andy, Kwame, Mei and Piotr.","\n","^LEADER: Andy is the head electrician and in charge of maintaining the quantum core, which makes him an obvious suspect.","\n","^LEADER: Kwame was spotted hanging out at the maintenance room at the time of the crime.","\n","^LEADER: Additionally, the core was found in Mei's room.
